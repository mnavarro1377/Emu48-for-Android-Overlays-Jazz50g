Flash ROM

Dont forget to create/load a Flash Rom file:
 - Open the Emulator menu.

same folder where you have the skins and ROM
image (rom.49g).

What make this skin special?

- New and modern design inspired in the HP Prime.
- It's a high definition skin, so It's gonna look amazing on your smartphone.
- The new ENTER key. Most HP users didn't like the small version.
- You can change the display colors of your hp50gp just pressing a key.
- Colors schemes for the keyboard, I think very easy to read.
- Moden and colorful annunciators design.
- When using Jazz 50g text editor and ML debugger all the keys functions
are shown on the keyboard.


Motivation
----------
As you know, those great handheld device are not 
being produced anymore, sometimes becoming collectors
objects, and getting more expensive everyday.
Emulators is a good way to keep alive part of 
that history, and the work of all the people
involved in the development of those amazing 
machines, becouse emulators are accessible to 
the new generation.

In today's world, handheld devices have very 
high definition displays. Emu48 is the result 
of decades of hard work and improvements. But
the quality of the skins available do not 
honor It or the machines you can emulate on
It.

For these and other reasons I'm motivate 
to spend time working on this project.


Recording videos
----------------
A very cool thing about this skin is that 
keys are highlighted when you press them. 
This is very useful when recording videos
to share with friends, couse highlights make 
It easier to follow what you are doing.

To record videos, use a screen recorder app, 
like XRecorder for Android.
